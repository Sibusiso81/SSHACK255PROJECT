&lt;strong&gt;Your Job&lt;/strong&gt;  
You will receive:

&lt;strong&gt;Your Task:&lt;/strong&gt;

1. Provide a &lt;strong&gt;clear, concise explanation&lt;/strong&gt; of the topic that a non-expert can easily understand. Use short, plain sentences. Use analogies if useful. Imagine explaining to a friend who knows nothing about cybersecurity.

2. Provide a list of &lt;strong&gt;2 to 3 helpful cybersecurity resources&lt;/strong&gt; related to the topic.  
Each resource must include:
- &quot;title&quot;: A short, clear title  
- &quot;description&quot;: 1–2 sentence description  
- &quot;url&quot;: A helpful link (must be real and useful)  
- &quot;image&quot;: A relevant image URL — only from &quot;images.unsplash.com&quot;

&lt;strong&gt;Formatting Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;

- Return everything in the user&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;preferred language&lt;/strong&gt;.

- All image URLs must be real and start with &quot;https://images.unsplash.com&quot;

I'm now focusing on how to explain website safety in Zulu, using everyday language. My goal is to make it easy to understand, like a friendly conversation, perhaps with a relatable comparison. I'm also preparing a list of resources to share, so the user can easily find more information about this topic.


**Developing Zulu Explanations**

I'm now crafting a simple Zulu explanation, aiming for a friendly, conversational tone. I've focused on using 'https' and the padlock icon as key indicators, along with warnings about suspicious URLs and excessive information requests. I'm also considering some everyday analogies to make the concepts even clearer and more relatable.


**Simplifying Zulu Advice**

I've crafted the Zulu explanation, focusing on key indicators like "https" and the padlock. I've also included warnings about suspicious URLs, excessive information requests, and unprofessional website appearances. My goal is to make it feel like a straightforward conversation, easy for the user to grasp. I am getting close to finalizing the resources I will share.


**Crafting the Zulu Explanation**

I've finalized the Zulu explanation about website safety, aiming for clarity and a friendly tone. I've covered key indicators like "https", the padlock icon, suspicious URLs, and excessive information requests. I've also touched on the website's look and feel, and am now selecting and translating the resources to be shared. The translation is almost complete.


**Sharing Zulu Website Tips**

I've just finalized the comprehensive Zulu explanation about spotting unsafe websites. I've covered all the key indicators like HTTPS, padlocks, suspicious URLs, excessive information requests, and website design. I've also selected and translated the resources to be shared, including the Google Safety Center, and found appropriate visual icons. I'm now getting ready to provide the complete package!


**Finalizing the Zulu Response**

I've crafted a comprehensive, user-friendly Zulu response. It clearly explains how to identify unsafe websites using simple language and relatable analogies. I've included key indicators like HTTPS and padlocks, along with warnings about suspicious URLs and excessive information requests.  I've also curated three reputable resources for further learning, complete with descriptions and image URLs.

Each object has the following fields:
- 'url': the website address
- 'connectionSecurity': indicates if HTTPS or another secure protocol is used (e.g., 'Secure', 'Not Secure')
- 'webRisk': general safety level based on known web risk data (e.g., 'Safe', 'Suspicious', 'Dangerous')
- 'malware': malware presence info (e.g., 'None', 'Malware detected')
- 'privacyPolicy': indicates if the site has a visible privacy policy (e.g., 'Found', 'Not found')

Instructions:
- Only report issues that are present in the input.
- If connection is not secure, web risk is 'Dangerous', or malware is detected, set 'overallStatus' to 'Threat'.
- If no major issues are found, set 'overallStatus' to 'Safe'.
- Do not invent or speculate about issues not present in the input.
- Tailor the summary and recommendations to the actual findings.
- Use concise, non-technical, and reassuring language for general users.
- Return ONLY the JSON object for each website, nothing else.
